            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Lupe Salas is a Bilingual producer, songwriter, singer music artist. Born and raised in Buenos Aires, Argentina, she lives in a cyber world worldwide.<br>
                Lupe started developing her love for music since a kid, at 8 years old, she knew she was destined to be a music artist, and was going to pursue that dream. She started getting basic knowledge of daws and music production in 2017, in 2018 bought a midi controller with a microphone, but she was still in high school so it wasn't until 2020 when she learnt how to produce music to its fullest by watching YouTube tutorials. In 2 months, she was creating her own songs.<br>
                At least for now, she does everything by herself, from the music production, songwriting, recording sessions, to the art covers even music videos, everything is directed by herself.<br>
                "I would love to bring something to this world, we all share same feelings, I would like to help people with my music and leave a message for my generation. I don't wanna be another fake artist who talks about depression. I want to talk about real stuff gen z is going thorugh. My experiences through trauma and having a hard childhood give me something to talk about. I hope my music helps you, just like it helped me"
